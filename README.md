Reflecting on what I have achieved during bootcamp


## Journey so far
1. I have learned how JavaScript serves as the basis of many web applications and is versatile. You can
code everything with vanilla JavaScript (which is a lot to do) or you can use Node or jQuery to create functional applications.
We also learned about API calls and how to fetch and post data to a page and present to the user. We also learned MySQL
for storing data and basics of MVC framework.

2. I have accomplished three projects and learned a great deal in the basics of web development and gained an understanding 
of the components of full stack development. I also was able to develop react application which is a desired to skill in the 
workforce.

3. I have changed a lot. At first, I was taking time to understand on how to write a for loop or taking time to develop
a basic html file. Now I have a solid understanding of programming logic and ternerary operators. I feel that I was able
to learn new topics a little quicker than at the beginning of the course.

## Path to success
1. My goal is to continue to learn especially with react and understanding mongoose, after the course is complete.
2. My hope to is to accomplish proficiency in developing MERN applications and have solid understanding of the stack.
3. I hope to accomplish personal projects with the material covered in the course. I want to be able to tackle new ideas
and make new solution in order to expand my github profile and add to person portfolio.
4. I will continue the habits of spending evenings to learn/practice skills. I am used to having class in the evenings 
so it would be productive to use the time normally alloted for class time as a window to work on personal projects.
5. These plans differ because the beginning of the course, I wanted to make sure I was grasping the material and try to
have a solid understanding of topics covered in class before proceeding the following weeks lesson plan. My goal now is focused
on long term growth as I want to apply for jobs releated to web development. My mentality is to continue to be a student, even
after bootcamp is done since technology evolves rapidly.
